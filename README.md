# random_name_generator
<br>
A little program which generates random name based on letters frequency.
<br>
NB! It generates completely random names, not based on real names.
<br>
I decided to make this program, because I am just the worst at naming things - be it a fantasy character, or email login, or my own project. I can spend hours thinking on more-less suitable name, so... here is the program.
<br>
A few names styles are available in the program and some will be added later. Generic is most random, plus it allowes two vowels or consonants go one after another in a row, that is clusters and diphthongs are possible (but random). Simplistic style will always have a vowel following a consonant and vice versa, disallowing clusters.
